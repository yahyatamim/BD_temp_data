# BD_temp_data
This repository contains daily maximum and minimum temperature data of Bangladesh over 42 stations from 1980 to 2020

Data was originally collected from https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/maps/daily/ and closely situated stations were marged for simplicity. 

Missing values are dealt by averaging that particular day from same station from data of available years and also with IDW interpolation from nearby stations.
